## Install
### Git
- Git clone this project.
- Copy this project into your own project.
- Add the .xcodeproj into you  project and link it as embed framework.
#### Options
- You can remove the `demo` and `ScreenShots` folder.

### CocoaPods
1. Add `pod "IRImagePickerController"` to Podfile
2. Run `pod install`
3. Add `#import <IRImagePickerController/IRImagePickerController.h>` to your code

## Usage

### Basic

1. Implement `IRImagePickerControllerDelegate` methods
2. Create `IRImagePickerController` object
3. Set `self` to the `delegate` property
4. Show the picker by using `presentViewController:animated:completion:`
```obj-c
    IRImagePickerController *imagePickerController = [IRImagePickerController new];
    imagePickerController.delegate = self;

    [self presentViewController:imagePickerController animated:YES completion:NULL];
```

### Delegate Methods

#### Getting the selected assets

Implement `ir_imagePickerController:didFinishPickingAssets:` to get the assets selected by the user.  
This method will be called when the user finishes picking assets.
```obj-c
    - (void)ir_imagePickerController:(IRImagePickerController *)imagePickerController didFinishPickingAssets:(NSArray *)assets {
        for (PHAsset *asset in assets) {
            // Do something with the asset
        }

        [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL];
    }
```

#### Getting notified when the user cancels

Implement `ir_imagePickerControllerDidCancel:` to get notified when the user hits "Cancel" button.
```obj-c
    - (void)ir_imagePickerControllerDidCancel:(IRImagePickerController *)imagePickerController {
        [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL];
    }
```

#### Getting notified when the selection is changed

You can handle the change of user's selection by implementing these methods.
```obj-c
    - (BOOL)ir_imagePickerController:(IRImagePickerController *)imagePickerController shouldSelectAsset:(PHAsset *)asset;
    - (void)ir_imagePickerController:(IRImagePickerController *)imagePickerController didSelectAsset:(PHAsset *)asset;
    - (void)ir_imagePickerController:(IRImagePickerController *)imagePickerController didDeselectAsset:(PHAsset *)asset;
```

### Customization

#### Selection mode

When `allowsMultipleSelection` is `YES`, the user can select multiple photos.  
The default value is `NO`.
```obj-c
    imagePickerController.allowsMultipleSelection = YES;
```
You can limit the number of selection by using `minimumNumberOfSelection` and `maximumNumberOfSelection` property.  
The default value is `0`, which means the number of selection is unlimited.
```obj-c
    imagePickerController.minimumNumberOfSelection = 3;
    imagePickerController.maximumNumberOfSelection = 6;
```

#### Specify the albums to be shown

Use `assetCollectionSubtypes` property to specify the albums to be shown.  
The code below shows the default value.
```obj-c
    imagePickerController.assetCollectionSubtypes = @[
        @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumUserLibrary), // Camera Roll
        @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeAlbumMyPhotoStream), // My Photo Stream
        @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumPanoramas), // Panoramas
        @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumVideos), // Videos
        @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumBursts) // Bursts
    ];
```
The albums will be ordered as you specified.  
User's albums are always shown after the smart albums.


#### Specify the media type to be shown

Use `mediaType` to filter the assets to be shown.  
The default value is `IRImagePickerMediaTypeAny`.
```obj-c
    imagePickerController.mediaType = IRImagePickerMediaTypeVideo;
```

#### Showing information

There are some properties to show helpful information.
```obj-c
    imagePickerController.prompt = @"Select the photos you want to upload!";
    imagePickerController.showsNumberOfSelectedAssets = YES;
```

#### Grid size

Use `numberOfColumnsInPortrait` and `numberOfColumnsInLandscape` to change the grid size.  
The code below shows the default value.
```obj-c
    imagePickerController.numberOfColumnsInPortrait = 4;
    imagePickerController.numberOfColumnsInLandscape = 7;
```
